Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you a brand new board game: The one and only Mind-Spun !!! Hours of mind-challenging puzzles await.

Mind-Spun is a puzzle game where you move neurons through a neural network trying to match their colors. Seems simple? Give it a try and you will see it is not! Bring your cup of coffee (or tea) and prepare to entangle your mind.

--------------------

Rules:
Take all the neurons to the cell with the same color.
Neurons can only be moved along the links.
The neurons that can be moved will be surrounded with a white circle, just click on one of them to move it to the empty cell.
Have fun!

--------------------

Controls:
Use the mouse to control almost all the game.
Press "+" to scale up the window.
Press "-" to scale down the window.
Press "Alt + Enter" to toggle fullscreen mode (may be buggy at the moment).

Thank you for playing Mind-Spun,
